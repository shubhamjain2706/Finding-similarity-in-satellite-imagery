# Finding-similarity-in-satellite-imagery

Worked under Prof. Andrew Schwartz

Languages, libraries and frameworks used: Python, Spark

Responsibilities:
1. Processed different images and converted them to feature vectors using NumPy and Spark RDDs.
2. Implemented Locality Sensitive Hashing to find the similar candidates by tweaking the number of rows, bands of the signature matrix.
3. Applied dimensionality reduction using PCA to reduce the number of features and calculated euclidean distance to find most similar images.
